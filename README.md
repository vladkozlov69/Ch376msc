# Arduino library for CH376 / CH375 file manager control chip
Supports read/write files to USB flash drive or SD card (CH375 only support USB flash drive).
>Why use this chip if there is already a library to handle the SD card and it is easier to just hook up the SD card(with resistors or SD card module) to Arduino?
>The SD library is widely used and is reliable, the only problem is the Arduino does't have to much memory and with the SD lib the MCU has to cope with the FAT file system,
>and we're just talking about SD card management, the USB storage drive handling is a more complicated and memory consuming procedure and you need a USB-HOST chip.
>The CH376 chip easily can write and read files even if they are on SD card or on Usb thumb-drive(CH375 only support USB thumb-drive). The chip supports FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32 file systems, meaning the chip does the hard work, 
>the MCU does not have to deal with the FAT file system, it only sends instructions to the chip on the communication bus you like (SPI, UART (HW serial, SW serial)), and the magic happens in the chip.
>The chip can do more, e.g to handle HID devices(usb keyboard, mouse, joystick ...) but this feature is not yet used in the library, maybe in the future.

## Getting Started

Configure the jumpers on the module depending on which communication protocol you are using(see [API reference](https://github.com/djuseeq/Ch376msc#api-reference))

 ### PCB modding for SD card
 > If you planning to use the chip for SD card also and you have a pcb like on the photo above, then some soldering skill is required.
 > First of all with a DMM check the pins of the chip(26,25,23 and 7) are theye floating or connected to GND/VCC.
 > On mine pcb the chip pin 23 (SD_CS) is connected to ground, like you can [see here](extras/schematic.png), 
 > pins or the chip have incorrect marking(looks like CH375 which one doesn't support SD card) . [Link](https://www.mpja.com/download/31813MPSch.pdf) for the module's schematic diagram. 
 > I used soldering iron and tweezer to lift up the pin from the pcb(be careful, you can easily break the chip's leg).
 > Follow [this schema](extras/modPcb.png) to make the proper connection between the chip and SD card socket.
 > I used a [SD card adapter](extras/sdAdapter.jpg) and for sake of stability, use the capacitors+1R resistor on Vcc line.
 > The SD card operate from 3.3V and this board already have a 3.3V voltage regulator so that is fine.
 > Here are some photos from the ugly modding ;) [Photo1](extras/board1.jpg) [Photo2](extras/board2.jpg).

## API Reference
```C++
//The SPI communication speed is reduced to 125 kHz because of stability if long cables or breadboard is used. 
//Options(Hz): 125000,250000,500000,1000000,2000000,4000000 not tested on a higher clock rate
//To change, edit /src/Ch376msc.h file. Find the #define SPICLKRATE line and change the value.
    //CONSTRUCTORS
     //UART
      //For hardware serial leave the communication settings on the module at default speed (9600bps) 
       Ch376msc(HardwareSerial, speed);//Select the serial port to which the module is connected and the desired speed(9600, 19200, 57600, 115200)
    
      //For software serial select the desired communication speed on the module(look on the picture above)
       Ch376msc(SoftwareSerial);
       
     //SPI
      //If no other device is connected to the SPI port it`s possible to save one MCU pin
       Ch376msc(spiSelect);// ! Don`t use this if the SPI port is shared with other devices
       
      //If the SPI port is shared with other devices, use this constructor and one extra MCU pin need to be sacrificed for the INT pin
       Ch376msc(spiSelect, interruptPin);

## Tested boards
|Board(arch) | SPI | HW Serial | SW Serial|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Arduino (AVR)|OK|OK|OK|
|DUE (SAM)|OK(with INT pin)|OK|NO|
|ZERO (SAMD)|OK|?|NO|
|*STM32 cores|OK|!NO|NO|
|**STM32duino|OK|OK|NO|
|***ESP8266|OK(with INT pin)|NO|OK|

Be careful when choosing SoftSerial because it has its own limitations. See [issues#15](https://github.com/djuseeq/Ch376msc/issues/15)

> `*` Tested on NUCLEO F446RE(no signal at all on UART ports)

> `**` Tested on Generic STM32F103C alias Blue pill with STM32duino bootloader

> `***` Tested on NodeMCU,(i'm not familiar with ESP MCUs) it looks they have default enabled WDT so i have to call
>	`yield()` periodically during file operations, otherwise ESP will restart with a ugly message.
>	Working SPI configuration (for me)is MISO-12(D6), MOSI-13(D7), SCK-14(D5), CS-4(D2), INT-5(D1)

### Test

I compared the two libraries with the same instructions, create file, write some text in it and read back the created file and send it to serial (SPI used)
Used Arduino IDE 1.8.10 on x64 linux, ArduinoUno board choosed

Sketch from SD library(SparkFun 1.2.4) ReadWrite example:

Program space used: 10704 bytes 33% ,

SRAM used: 882 bytes 43%

```C++
#include <SPI.h>
#include <SD.h>

File myFile;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  SD.begin(4);
  myFile = SD.open("TEST.TXT", FILE_WRITE);
  if (myFile) {
    myFile.println("testing 1, 2, 3.");
    myFile.close();
  }
  myFile = SD.open("TEST.TXT");
    while (myFile.available()) {
      Serial.write(myFile.read());
    }
    myFile.close();
}

void loop() {}

```

Second sketch is Ch376msc library(1.4.2)

1. if i put in comments the setSorce function and use the default USB storage

    Program space used: 6760 bytes 20% ,
    SRAM used: 315 bytes 15%
2. with setSorce function choosed USB storage

    Program space used: 6810 bytes 21% ,
    SRAM used: 315 bytes 15%
3. with setSorce function choosed SD storage

    Program space used: 6824 bytes 21% ,
    SRAM used: 315 bytes 15%

```C++
#include <Ch376msc.h>

Ch376msc flashDrive(10); // chipSelect
char adat[]={"testing 1, 2, 3."};
boolean readMore = true;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  flashDrive.init();
  flashDrive.setSource(0);//0 - USB, 1 - SD
  flashDrive.setFileName("TEST.TXT");
  flashDrive.openFile();
  flashDrive.writeFile(adat, strlen(adat));
  flashDrive.closeFile(); 
  flashDrive.setFileName("TEST.TXT");
  flashDrive.openFile();
  while(readMore){
     readMore = flashDrive.readFile(adat, sizeof(adat));
     Serial.print(adat);
  }
  flashDrive.closeFile();
}

void loop() {}
```
